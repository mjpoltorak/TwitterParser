This python script parses twitter in real time to deliver live tweets including a specified keyword. This code was originally part of a youtube tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_26vpe-PGo&t=839s), however it has been modified by Matthew Poltorak. 

To run this program please make sure you have installed the following libraries: http.cookiejar, urllib.request, difflib, functools, re, time

As of now the default search is "Saumsung". Currently the only way to change this is in the code, however in a later version, user input from the command line will be supported. *Note: The keyword can not have any spaces
